        <p>After 14 years, three revisions, and two different processor architectures, the iconic wedge shape of the MacBook
            Air is now history. In its place is a MacBook Air with a completely new design that’s the same thickness from
            front to back. Virtually every aspect of the new MacBook Air has been updated or changed — it’s the biggest
            update to the Air since it originally debuted nearly a decade and a half ago.

            These kinds of changes are a big deal because the Air is the default laptop option for millions of people.
            Beyond that, the Air sets the standard for thin and light laptops that every other manufacturer chases.

            In addition to the design and hardware changes, this new Air has Apple’s latest in-house processor, the M2. It
            also comes with a higher price tag — it starts at $1,199, $200 more than the model that preceded it, and a model
            with a decent amount of storage runs $1,499 or more. As a result, Apple is keeping the prior M1 model in its
            lineup, specifically to provide an option for the many MacBook Air buyers that don’t want to spend much more
            than $1,000 on a new computer.</p>
